# BookListRazor

This is an ASP.Net Core (3.1) Razor pages example project I built while following [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-aspnet-core-21-course/) on Udemy.

It covers the following subject areas:

- Basic understanding of middlewares
- ADO.Net Entity Framework for model migrations to a Microsoft SQL Server Database
- C.R.U.D. operations using API calls

Currently in process of deploying to heroku
